# RotaryEncodex

Some simple logic to use a rotary encoder in Elixir.  Turning clockwise will increment a counter, turning counterclockwise will decrement it.   You can call `RotaryEncodex.get_value()` to get the current value of the counter.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `rotaryencodex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:rotaryencodex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
